    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    
    <h3 id="scope">Scope of this document</h3>
    
    <p>This document covers the W3C HTML5 specification, W3C HTML5.1 specification, and
    the WHATWG HTML standard. These are referred to as if they were a single specification
    as "the HTML specification" or simply "HTML" when something applies equally to all of
    them, and otherwise they are called out explicitly.
    
    <h3 id="history">History of HTML</h3>

    <p>HTML has been in continuous evolution since it was introduced to the
    Internet in the early 1990s. Some features were introduced in
    specifications; others were introduced in software releases. In some
    respects, implementations and Web developer practices have converged with each
    other and with specifications and standards, but in other ways, they
    have diverged.</p>

    <p>HTML4 became a W3C Recommendation in 1997. While it continues
    to serve as a rough guide to many of the core features of HTML, it does
    not provide enough information to build implementations that
    interoperate with each other and, more importantly, with a critical mass
    of deployed content. The same goes for XHTML1, which defines an
    XML serialization for HTML4, and DOM Level 2 HTML, which defines
    JavaScript APIs for both HTML and XHTML. HTML replaces these documents. <span data-anolis-ref>DOM2HTML</span>
    <span data-anolis-ref>HTML4</span>
    <span data-anolis-ref>XHTML1</span>

    <p>The HTML specification reflects an effort, started in 2004, to study
    contemporary HTML implementations and deployed content. The specification:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Defines a single language called HTML which can be written
      in HTML syntax and in XML syntax.</li>
      <li>Defines detailed processing models to foster interoperable
      implementations.</li>
      <li>Improves markup for documents.</li>
      <li>Introduces markup and APIs for emerging idioms, such as Web
      applications.</li>
    </ol>


    <h3 id="open-issues">Open Issues</h3>

    <p>The contents of HTML, as well as the contents of this document which depend on
    HTML, are still being discussed on the HTML Working Group
    and WHATWG mailing lists. The open issues are linked from the HTML specification.</p>


    <h3 id="backwards-compatible">Backwards Compatible</h3>

    <p>HTML is defined in a way that it is backwards compatible with
    the way user agents handle deployed content. To keep the
    language relatively simple for Web developers, several elements and attributes
    are not included, as outlined in the other sections of this document,
    such as presentational elements that are better dealt with using
    CSS.</p>

    <p>User agents, however, will always have to support these older
    elements and attributes and this is why the HTML specification clearly
    separates requirements for Web developers (referred to as "authors" in the
    specification) and user agents. For instance, this
    means that Web developers cannot use the <code data-anolis-spec=html>isindex</code> or the
    <code data-anolis-spec=html>plaintext</code> element, but user agents are required to support
    them in a way that is compatible with how these elements need to behave
    for compatibility with deployed content.</p>

    <p>Since HTML has separate conformance requirements for Web developers
    and user agents there is no longer a need for marking features
    "deprecated".</p>


    <h3 id="development-model">Development Model</h3>
    
    <p>The HTML4 specification reached Recommendation status before it was completely
    implemented in user agents. HTML4 still is not completely implemented, because it
    contains various bugs that have been fixed in the current HTML specification, which
    user agents are much closer to than HTML4.

    <p>The WHATWG HTML standard is under continual development where bugs are fixed
    and new features are introduced over time. Features can also be removed from the
    specification if they lack implementor interest or are not being used by Web developers, or
    for other reasons. The WHATWG does not publish frozen snapshots.
    
    <p>The W3C HTML5 specification is trying to reach Recommendation status. New features
    are generally not added unless they are implemented by at least two browsers and has
    tests demonstrating interoperability. Minor bug fixes can be applied. This means that
    it may contain bugs that have been fixed in WHATWG HTML or W3C HTML5.1, or both.
    
    <p>The W3C HTML5.1 specification is similar to WHATWG HTML: it is under continual development where bugs are fixed and new features are introduced over time,
    and features can be removed from the specification for the same reasons as with WHATWG HTML. It cherry-picks changes from the WHATWG HTML standard and also
    gets direct changes. It is expected to eventually go through the same procedure as W3C HTML5, and then a new version will be minted.


    <h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>

    <p>HTML defines an HTML syntax that is
    compatible with HTML4 and XHTML1 documents published on the
    Web, but is not compatible with the more esoteric SGML features of
    HTML4, such as
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/appendix/notes.html#h-B.3.6">processing instructions</a>
    and
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/appendix/notes.html#h-B.3.7">shorthand markup</a>
    as these are not supported by most user agents. Documents using the HTML
    syntax are served with the <code>text/html</code> media
    type.</p>

    <p>HTML also defines detailed parsing rules (including "error
    handling") for this syntax which are largely compatible with HTML4-era
    implementations. User agents must use these rules for resources that
    have the <code>text/html</code> media type. Here is an example document
    that conforms to the HTML syntax:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html>
&lt;html>
  &lt;head>
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8">
    &lt;title>Example document&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;p>Example paragraph&lt;/p>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></code></pre>

    <p>The other syntax that can be used for HTML is XML. This syntax
    is compatible with XHTML1 documents and implementations. Documents
    using this syntax need to be served with an XML media type and elements
    need to be put in the <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>
    namespace following the rules set forth by the XML specifications.
    <span data-anolis-ref>XML</span>

    <p>Below is an example document that conforms to the XML syntax of
    HTML. Note that XML documents must be served with an XML media type
    such as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> or
    <code>application/xml</code>.</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>Example document&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;p>Example paragraph&lt;/p>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></code></pre>

    <h3 id="character-encoding">Character Encoding</h3>

    <p>For the HTML syntax, Web developers are required to declare the
    character encoding. There are three ways to do that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>At the transport level. By using the HTTP <code>Content-Type</code>
      header for instance.</li>

      <li>Using a Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) character at the start of
      the file. This character provides a signature for the encoding
      used.</li>

      <li>Using a <code data-anolis-spec=html>meta</code> element with a <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-meta-charset>charset</code>
      attribute that specifies the encoding within the first 1024 bytes of
      the document. For instance, <code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"></code>
      could be used to specify the UTF-8 encoding. This replaces the need
      for
      <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"></code>
      although that syntax is still allowed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the XML syntax, Web developers have to use the rules as set forth in the
    XML specifications to set the character encoding.</p>

    <h3 id="doctype">The Doctype</h3>

    <p>The HTML syntax requires a doctype to be specified to ensure
    that the browser renders the page in standards mode. The doctype has no
    other purpose. <span data-anolis-ref>DOCTYPE</span>

    <p>The doctype declaration for the HTML syntax is <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html></code> and is
    case-insensitive. Doctypes from earlier versions of
    HTML were longer because the HTML language was SGML-based and therefore
    required a reference to a DTD. This is no longer the case and
    the doctype is only needed to enable standards mode for documents
    written using the HTML syntax. Browsers already do this for
    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html></code>.</p>

    <p>To support legacy markup generators that cannot generate the preferred
    short doctype, the doctype <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM
    "about:legacy-compat"></code> is allowed in the HTML syntax.

    <p>The strict doctypes for HTML 4.0, HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0 as well as XHTML
    1.1 are also allowed (but are discouraged) in the HTML syntax.

    <p>In the XML syntax, any doctype declaration may be used, or it may be
    omitted altogether. Documents with an XML media type are always handled in
    standards mode.


    <h3 id="mathml-svg">MathML and SVG</h3>

    <p>The HTML syntax allows for MathML and SVG elements to
    be used inside a document. An <code>math</code> or <code>svg</code> start
    tag causes the HTML parser to switch to a special insertion mode which puts
    elements and attributes in the appropriate namespaces, does case fixups for
    elements and attributes that have mixed case, and supports the empty-element
    syntax as in XML. The syntax is still case-insensitive and attributes allow
    the same syntax as for HTML elements. Namespace declarations may be omitted.
    CDATA sections are supported in this insertion mode.

    <p>Some MathML and SVG elements cause the parser to switch back to "HTML
    mode", e.g. <code>mtext</code> and <code>foreignObject</code>, so you can
    use HTML elements or a new <code>math</code> or <code>svg</code> element.

    <p>For instance, a very simple document using some of the
    minimal syntax features could look like:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html>
&lt;title>SVG in text/html&lt;/title>
&lt;p>
 A green circle:
 <strong>&lt;svg> &lt;circle r="50" cx="50" cy="50" fill="green"/> &lt;/svg></strong>
&lt;/p></code></pre>

    <h3 id="syntax-misc">Miscellaneous</h3>

    <p>There are a few other changes in the HTML syntax worthy of mentioning:</p>

    <ul>
     <li><p>The <code>&amp;lang;</code> and <code>&amp;rang;</code> named character
     references now expand to U+27E8 and U+27E9 instead of U+2329 and U+232A,
     respectively.

     <li><p>Many new named character references have been added, including all from
     MathML.

     <li><p>Void elements (known as "EMPTY" in HTML4) are allowed to have a
     trailing slash.

     <li><p>The ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) may be left unescaped in some more
     cases compared to HTML4.

     <li><p>Attributes have to be separated by at least one whitespace character.

     <li><p>Attributes with an empty value may be written as just the attribute
     name omitting the equals sign and the value, even if it's not a boolean
     attribute. (HTML4 actually allowed using only the attribute
     <em>value</em> and omitting the attribute name, for enumerated attributes,
     but this was not supported in browsers.)

     <li><p>Attributes omitting quotes for the value are allowed to use a larger
     set of characters compared to HTML4.

     <li><p>The <code>optgroup</code> end tag is now optional.

     <li><p>The <code>colgroup</code> start tag is now optional and is inferred by
     the HTML parser.
    </ul>


    <h2 id="language">Language</h2>

    <p>This section is split up in several subsections to more clearly
    illustrate the various differences there are from HTML4.</p>


    <h3 id="new-elements">New Elements</h3>

    <p>The following elements have been introduced for better structure:</p>

  <ul>
      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>section</code>
      represents a generic document or application section. It can be
      <span data-anolis-spec=html title="Headings and sections">used together</span>
      with the <code data-anolis-spec=html>h1</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html>h2</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html>h3</code>,
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>h4</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html>h5</code>, and <code data-anolis-spec=html>h6</code> elements to
      indicate the document structure.</p></li>

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>article</code>
      represents an independent piece of content of a document, such as a
      blog entry or newspaper article.</p></li>

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>main</code>
      can be used as a container for the dominant contents of another element, such as
      the main content of the page.</p></li>

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>aside</code>
      represents a piece of content that is only slightly related to the
      rest of the page.</p></li>

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>hgroup</code>
      represents the header of a section.</p></li>

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>header</code>
      represents a group of introductory or navigational aids.</p></li>

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>footer</code>
      represents a footer for a section and can contain information about
      the author, copyright information, etc.</p></li>

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>nav</code>
      represents a section of the document intended for navigation.</p></li>

      <li>
        <p><code data-anolis-spec=html>figure</code>
        represents a piece of self-contained flow content, typically
        referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document.</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;figure>
 &lt;video src="example.webm" controls>&lt;/video>
 &lt;figcaption>Example&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure></code></pre>

        <p><code data-anolis-spec=html>figcaption</code> can be used as caption (it is optional).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then there are several other new elements:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>video</code> and
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>audio</code> for multimedia content. Both
      provide an API so application Web developers can script their own user
      interface, but there is also a way to trigger a user interface
      provided by the user agent. <code data-anolis-spec=html>source</code>
      elements are used together with these elements if there are multiple
      streams available of different types.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>track</code> provides text tracks
      for the <code data-anolis-spec=html>video</code> element.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>embed</code> is used for plugin
      content.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>mark</code> represents a run of
      text in one document marked or highlighted for reference purposes, due
      to its relevance in another context.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>progress</code> represents a

      measurement, such as disk usage.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>time</code> represents a date
      and/or time.

      <li><p>WHATWG HTML and W3C HTML5.1 has <code data-anolis-spec=html>data</code> which
      allows content to be annotated with a machine-readable value.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>dialog</code> for showing a dialog.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>ruby</code>,
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>rt</code>, and
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>rp</code> allow for marking up ruby
      annotations.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>bdi</code> represents a span of
      text that is to be isolated from its surroundings for the purposes of
      bidirectional text formatting.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>wbr</code> represents a line break
      opportunity.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>canvas</code> is used for rendering

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>menuitem</code>
      represents a command the user can invoke from a popup menu.</p></li>

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>details</code>
      represents additional information or controls which the user can
      obtain on demand. The
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>summary</code>
      element provides its summary, legend, or caption.</p></li>

      <li>
        <p><code data-anolis-spec=html>datalist</code>
        together with the a new <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-list>list</code> attribute for
        <code data-anolis-spec=html>input</code> can be used to make comboboxes:</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;input <strong>list="browsers"</strong>>
&lt;datalist <strong>id="browsers"</strong>>
 &lt;option value="Safari">
 &lt;option value="Internet Explorer">
 &lt;option value="Opera">
 &lt;option value="Firefox">
&lt;/datalist></code></pre>
      </li>

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>keygen</code>
      represents control for key pair generation.</p></li>

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>output</code>
      represents some type of output, such as from a calculation done
      through scripting.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>input</code> element's <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type>type</code> attribute now has the
    following new values:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-tel>tel</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-search>search</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-url>url</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-email>email</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-datetime>datetime</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-date>date</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-month>month</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-week>week</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-time>time</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-datetime-local>datetime-local</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-number>number</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-range>range</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-color>color</code>
    </ul>

    <p>The idea of these new types is that the user agent can provide the user
    interface, such as a calendar date picker or integration with the user's
    address book, and submit a defined format to the server. It gives the user a
    better experience as his input is checked before sending it to the server
    meaning there is less time to wait for feedback.</p>


    <h3 id="new-attributes">New Attributes</h3>

    <p>Several attributes have been introduced to various elements
    that were already part of HTML4:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>a</code> and
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>area</code> elements have the new
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-hyperlink-download>download</code> attribute
      in WHATWG HTML and W3C HTML5.1. WHATWG HTML also has the
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-hyperlink-ping>ping</code> attribute.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>area</code> element, for consistency with the
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>a</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html>link</code> elements, now also has the
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-hyperlink-hreflang>hreflang</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-hyperlink-type>type</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-hyperlink-rel>rel</code> attributes.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>base</code> element can now have a <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-base-target>target</code>
      attribute as well, mainly for consistency with the
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>a</code> element. (This is already widely supported.)

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>meta</code> element has a <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-meta-charset>charset</code>
      attribute now as this was already widely supported and provides a nice
      way to specify the
      <a href="#character-encoding">character encoding</a> for the document.
      
      <li><p>In WHATWG HTML and W3C HTML5.1, the <code data-anolis-spec=html>table</code>
      element now has a <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-table-sortable>sortable</code> attribute and the
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>th</code> element has a
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-th-sorted>sorted</code> attribute, which provide a means to sort
      table columns.

      <li><p>A new <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fe-autofocus>autofocus</code> attribute can be specified on the
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>input</code> (except when the <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type>type</code> attribute is
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-hidden>hidden</code>), <code data-anolis-spec=html>select</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html>textarea</code> and
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>button</code> elements. It provides a declarative way to focus a
      form control during page load. Using this feature should enhance the
      user experience compared to focusing the element with script as the user can turn it off if the user does not like
      it, for instance.

      <li>
       <p>A new <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-placeholder>placeholder</code> attribute can be specified on
      the <code data-anolis-spec=html>input</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html>textarea</code> elements. It
      represents a hint intended to aid the user with data entry.</p>
       <pre><code>&lt;input type=email <strong>placeholder="a@b.com"</strong>></code></pre>
      </li>

      <li>
       <p>The new <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fae-form>form</code> attribute for <code data-anolis-spec=html>input</code>,
       <code data-anolis-spec=html>output</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html>select</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html>textarea</code>,
       <code data-anolis-spec=html>button</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html>label</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html>object</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html>fieldset</code> elements allows for
       controls to be associated with a form. These elements can now be
       placed anywhere on a page, not just as descendants of the
       <code data-anolis-spec=html>form</code> element, and still be associated with a <code data-anolis-spec=html>form</code>.</p>

       <pre>&lt;table>
 &lt;tr>
  &lt;th>Key
  &lt;th>Value
  &lt;th>Action
 &lt;tr>
  &lt;td>&lt;form <strong>id=1</strong>>&lt;input name=1-key>&lt;/form>
  &lt;td>&lt;input <strong>form=1</strong> name=1-value>
  &lt;td>&lt;button <strong>form=1</strong> name=1-action value=save>&#x2713;&lt;/button>
      &lt;button <strong>form=1</strong> name=1-action value=delete>&#x2717;&lt;/button>
 ...
&lt;/table></pre>
      </li>

      <li><p>The new <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-required>required</code> attribute applies to
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>input</code> (except when the <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type>type</code> attribute is
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-hidden>hidden</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-image>image</code> or some button type such as
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-type-submit>submit</code>), <code data-anolis-spec=html>select</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html>textarea</code>. It indicates that the user
      has to fill in a value in order to submit the form. For <code data-anolis-spec=html>select</code>, the first <code data-anolis-spec=html>option</code> element has to be a placeholder with an empty value.

      <pre><code>&lt;label>Color: &lt;select name=color <strong>required</strong>>
 &lt;option <strong>value=""</strong>>Choose one
 &lt;option>Red
 &lt;option>Green
 &lt;option>Blue
&lt;/select>&lt;/label></code></pre>

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>fieldset</code> element now allows the
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fieldset-disabled>disabled</code> attribute which disables all descendant controls (excluding those that are descendants of the <code data-anolis-spec=html>legend</code> element)
      when specified, and the <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fe-name>name</code> attribute which can be used for script access.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>input</code> element has several new attributes to
      specify constraints: <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fe-autocomplete>autocomplete</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-min>min</code>,
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-max>max</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-multiple>multiple</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-pattern>pattern</code> and
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-step>step</code>. As mentioned before it also has a new
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-input-list>list</code> attribute which can be used together with the
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>datalist</code> element. It also now has the <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-dim-width>width</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-dim-height>height</code> attributes to specify the dimensions of the image when using <code>type=image</code>.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>input</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html>textarea</code> elements have
      a new attribute named <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fe-dirname>dirname</code> that causes the
      directionality of the control as set by the user to be submitted as
      well.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>textarea</code> element also has two new attributes,
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-textarea-maxlength>maxlength</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-textarea-wrap>wrap</code> which control max input
      length and submitted line wrapping behavior, respectively.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>form</code> element has a <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fs-novalidate>novalidate</code>
      attribute that can be used to disable form validation submission (i.e.
      the form can always be submitted).

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>input</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html>button</code> elements have
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fs-formaction>formaction</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fs-formenctype>formenctype</code>,
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fs-formmethod>formmethod</code>, <code  data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fs-formnovalidate>formnovalidate</code>, and
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fs-formtarget>formtarget</code> as new attributes. If present, they override
      the <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fs-action>action</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fs-enctype>enctype</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fs-method>method</code>,
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fs-novalidate>novalidate</code>, and <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fs-target>target</code> attributes on the
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>form</code> element.</p>

      <li><p>In WHATWG HTML, the <code data-anolis-spec=html>input</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html>textarea</code> have an <code data-anolis-spec=html title="attr-fe-inputmode">inputmode</code> attribute.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>menu</code> element has two new attributes:
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-menu-type>type</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-menu-label>label</code>. They
      allow the element to transform into a menu as found in typical user
      interfaces as well as providing for context menus in conjunction with the
      global <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-contextmenu>contextmenu</code> attribute.
      
      <li><p>In WHATWG HTML and W3C HTML5.1, the <code data-anolis-spec=html>button</code>
      element has a new <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-button-menu>menu</code>
      attribute, used together with popup menus.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>style</code> element has a new <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-style-scoped>scoped</code>
      attribute which can be used to enable scoped style sheets. Style rules
      within such a <code data-anolis-spec=html>style</code> element only apply to the local tree.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>script</code> element has a new attribute called
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-script-async>async</code> that influences script loading and execution.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>html</code> element has a new attribute called
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-html-manifest>manifest</code> that points to an application cache manifest
      used in conjunction with the API for offline Web applications.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>link</code> element has a new attribute called
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-link-sizes>sizes</code>. It can be used in conjunction with the
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=rel-icon>icon</code> relationship (set through the <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-link-rel>rel</code>
      attribute; can be used for e.g. favicons) to indicate the size of the
      referenced icon. Thus allowing for icons of distinct dimensions.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>ol</code> element has a new attribute called
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-ol-reversed>reversed</code>. When present, it indicates that the list order
      is descending.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>iframe</code> element has three new attributes called
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-iframe-sandbox>sandbox</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-iframe-seamless>seamless</code>, and <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-iframe-srcdoc>srcdoc</code>
      which allow for sandboxing content, e.g. blog comments.</p></li>

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>object</code> element has a new attribute called <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-object-typemustmatch>typemustmatch</code> which allows safer embedding of external resources.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>img</code> element has a new attribute called
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-img-crossorigin>crossorigin</code> to use CORS in the fetch and if it is successful, allows the image data to be
      read with the <code data-anolis-spec=html>canvas</code> API. In WHATWG HTML and W3C HTML 5.1, the <code data-anolis-spec=html>script</code> element has a
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-script-crossorigin>crossorigin</code> attribute to allow script
      <span data-anolis-spec=html title="report the error">errors to be reported</span> to <code data-anolis-spec=html title=handler-onerror>onerror</code>
      with information about the error. WHATWG HTML and W3C HTML 5.1 also has the <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-link-crossorigin>crossorigin</code>
      attribute on the <code data-anolis-spec=html>link</code> element.
      
      <li><p>In WHATWG HTML, the <code data-anolis-spec=html>img</code> element has a new attribute called <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-img-srcset>srcset</code> to support multiple images for different resolutions and different images for different viewport sizes.
    </ul>

    <p>Several attributes from HTML4 now apply to all elements. These
    are called global attributes: <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-accesskey>accesskey</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-class>class</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-dir>dir</code>,
    <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-id>id</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-dir>lang</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-style>style</code>,
    <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-tabindex>tabindex</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-title>title</code>. Additionally, XHTML 1.0
    only allowed <code>xml:space</code> on some elements, which is now allowed
    on all elements in XHTML documents.</p>

    <p>There are also several new global attributes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-contenteditable>contenteditable</code> attribute indicates that
      the element is an editable area. The user can change the contents of the
      element and manipulate the markup.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-contextmenu>contextmenu</code> attribute can be used to point
      to a context menu provided by the Web developer.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title="attr-data-*">data-<var>*</var></code> collection of Web developer-defined
      attributes. Web developers can define any attribute they want as long as they
      prefix it with <code>data-</code> to avoid clashes with future versions of
      HTML. These are intended to be used to store custom data to be consumed by
      the Web page or application itself. They are <em>not</em> intended for
      data to be consumed by other parties (e.g. user agents).

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-draggable>draggable</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-dropzone>dropzone</code> attributes can be used together with
      the new drag &amp; drop API.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-hidden>hidden</code>
      attribute indicates that an element is not yet, or is no longer, relevant.

      <li><p>WHATWG HTML has the <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-inert>inert</code> attribute, intended to make <code data-anolis-spec=html>dialog</code> elements modal.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=wai-aria>role</code> and
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=wai-aria>aria-<var>*</var></code>
      collection attributes which can be used to instruct assistive
      technology.</li>

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-spellcheck>spellcheck</code> attribute allows for hinting
      whether content can be checked for spelling or not.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-translate>translate</code> attribute gives a hint to
      translators whether the content should be translated.

    </ul>

    <p>HTML also makes all event handler attributes from HTML4, which take the
    form <code>on<var>event</var></code>, global attributes and adds
    several new event handler attributes for new events it defines. For
    instance, the <code data-anolis-spec=html title=handler-onplay>onplay</code>
    event handler attribute for the <code data-anolis-spec=html
    title=event-media-play>play</code> event which is used by the API for the
    media elements (<code data-anolis-spec=html>video</code> and <code
    data-anolis-spec=html>audio</code>).</p>


    <h3 id="changed-elements">Changed Elements</h3>

    <p>These elements have slightly modified meanings in HTML to
    better reflect how they are used on the Web or to make them more
    useful:</p>

    <ul>
      <!--
      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>a</code> element without an
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-hyperlink-href>href</code>
      attribute now represents a placeholder for where a link otherwise
      might have been placed.</p></li>

      html4:
      Each  A element defines an anchor

      1. The  A element's content defines the position of the anchor.
      2. The  name attribute names the anchor so that it may be the destination
      of zero or more links (see also anchors with  id).
      3. The  href attribute makes this anchor the source anchor of exactly one
      link.

      Authors may also create an A element that specifies no anchors, i.e., that
      doesn't specify href, name, or id. Values for these attributes may be set
      at a later time through scripts.

      html:
      If the a element has an href attribute, then it represents a hyperlink (a
      hypertext anchor).

      If the a element has no href attribute, then the element represents a
      placeholder for where a link might otherwise have been placed, if it had
      been relevant.

      Both basically say that <a> without href is a "placeholder", so this isn't
      really a change.

      These elements define content to be inline (SPAN) or block-level (DIV) but

      use these elements in conjunction with style sheets, the lang attribute,
      etc., to tailor HTML to their own needs and tastes.

      html:
      The div element has no special meaning at all. It represents its children.

      but do not affect importance.

      html4:
      A heading element briefly describes the topic of the section it
      introduces. Heading information may be used by user agents, for example,
      to construct a table of contents for a document automatically.

      There are six levels of headings in HTML with H1 as the most important and
      H6 as the least. Visual browsers usually render more important headings in
      larger fonts than less important ones.

      These elements represent headings for their sections.

      The semantics and meaning of these elements are defined in the section on
      headings and sections.

      These elements have a rank given by the number in their name. The h1
      element is said to have the highest rank, the h6 element has the lowest

      html:
      The q element represents some phrasing content quoted from another source.
      -->

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>s</code> element now represents
      contents that are no longer accurate or no longer relevant.</p></li>

      <!--
      SAMP
      html4:
      Designates sample output from programs, scripts, etc.

      html:
      The samp element represents (sample) output from a program or computing
      system.
      -->

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>script</code> element can now be
      used for scripts or for custom data blocks.

      <!--
      SELECT
      html4:
      The  SELECT element creates a menu. Menus offer users options from which
      to choose.

      options.
      -->

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>small</code> element now represents
      side comments such as small print.</p></li>

      <!--
      SPAN
      html4:
      The  DIV and SPAN elements, in conjunction with the id and  class
      attributes, offer a generic mechanism for adding structure to documents.
      These elements define content to be inline (SPAN) or block-level (DIV) but
      impose no other presentational idioms on the content. Thus, authors may
      use these elements in conjunction with style sheets, the lang attribute,
      etc., to tailor HTML to their own needs and tastes.

      html:
      The span element doesn't mean anything on its own, but can be useful when
      used together with the global attributes, e.g. class, lang, or dir. It
      represents its children.
      -->

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>strong</code> element now
      represents importance rather than strong emphasis.</p></li>

      <!--
      STYLE
      html4:
      The  STYLE element allows authors to put style sheet rules in the head of
      the document.

      html:
      The style element allows authors to embed style information in their
      documents. The style element is one of several inputs to the styling
      processing model. The element does not represent content for the user.
      -->

      <!--
      SUB and SUP
      html4:
      Many scripts (e.g., French) require superscripts or subscripts for proper
      rendering. The  SUB and SUP elements should be used to markup text in
      these cases.

      html:
      The sup element represents a superscript and the sub element represents a
      subscript.
      -->

      <!--
      TABLE
      html4:
      The  TABLE element contains all other elements that specify caption, rows,
      content, and formatting.

      html:
      The table element represents data with more than one dimension, in the
      form of a table.
      -->

      <!--
      TBODY
      html4:
      The table body should contain rows of table data.

      html:
      The tbody element represents a block of rows that consist of a body of
      data for the parent table element, if the tbody element has a parent and
      it is a table.
      -->

      <!--
      TD
      html4:
      The  TD element defines a cell that contains data.

      html:
      The td element represents a data cell in a table.
      -->

      <!--
      TEXTAREA
      html4:
      The  TEXTAREA element creates a  multi-line text input control. User
      agents should use the contents of this element as the initial value of
      the control and should render this text initially.

      html:
      The textarea element represents a multiline plain text edit control for
      the element's raw value. The contents of the control represent the control's default value.
      -->

      <!--
      TFOOT
      html4:
      The table head and table foot should contain information about the table's
      columns.

      html:
      The tfoot element represents the block of rows that consist of the column
      summaries (footers) for the parent table element, if the tfoot element has
      a parent and it is a table.
      -->

      <!--
      TH
      html4:
      The  TH element defines a cell that contains header information.

      html:

      labels (headers) for the parent table element, if the thead element has a
      parent and it is a table.
      -->

      <!--
      TITLE
      html4:
      Authors should use the TITLE element to identify the contents of a
      document. Since users often consult documents out of context, authors
      should provide context-rich titles.

      html:
      The title element represents the document's title or name. Authors should
      use titles that identify their documents even when they are used out of
      context, for example in a user's history or bookmarks, or in search
      results.
      -->

      <!--
      TR
      html4:
      The  TR elements acts as a container for a row of table cells.

      html:
      The tr element represents a row of cells in a table.
      -->

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>u</code> element now represents a
      span of text with an unarticulated, though explicitly rendered,
      non-textual annotation, such as labeling the text as being a proper name
      in Chinese text (a Chinese proper name mark), or labeling the text as
      being misspelt.</p></li>

      <!--
      UL
      html4:
      Ordered and unordered lists are rendered in an identical manner except
      that visual user agents number ordered list items. User agents may present
      those numbers in a variety of ways. Unordered list items are not numbered.

      html:
      The ul element represents a list of items, where the order of the items is
      not important — that is, where changing the order would not materially
      change the meaning of the document.
      -->

      <!--
      VAR
      html4:
      Indicates an instance of a variable or program argument.

      html:
      The var element represents a variable. This could be an actual variable in
      a mathematical expression or programming context, an identifier
      representing a constant, a function parameter, or just be a term used as a
      placeholder in prose.
      -->

    </ul>

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-accesskey>accesskey</code> global attribute now allows multiple
      characters to be specified, which the user agent can choose from.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fs-action>action</code>
      attribute on <code data-anolis-spec=html>form</code> is no longer allowed
      to have an empty URL.

      <li><p>In WHATWG HTML, the <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fs-method>method</code> attribute has a new keyword <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-fs-method-dialog-keyword>dialog</code>, intended to close a <code data-anolis-spec=html>dialog</code> element.

      <li><p>The <code>border</code> attribute on <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>table</code> only allows the values "1" and the
      empty string. In WHATWG HTML, the <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-table-border>border</code> attribute is obsolete.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-tdth-colspan>colspan</code> attribute on <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>td</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html>th</code>
      now has to be greater than zero.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-area-coords>coords</code> attribute on <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>area</code> no longer allows a percentage value of
      the radius when the element is in the circle state.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-object-data>data</code>
      attribute on <code data-anolis-spec=html>object</code> is no longer said
      to be relative to the <code>codebase</code> attribute.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-script-defer>defer</code> attribute on <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>script</code> now explicitly makes the script
      execute when the page has finished parsing.

      attribute now allows the value <code>auto</code>.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html

      <code>text/plain</code>.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-dim-width>width</code>
      and <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-dim-height>height</code>
      attributes on <code data-anolis-spec=html>img</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>iframe</code> and <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>object</code> are no longer allowed to contain
      percentages. They are also not allowed to be used to stretch the image to

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-link-href>href</code>
      attribute on <code data-anolis-spec=html>link</code> is no longer allowed
      to have an empty URL.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-base-href>href</code>
      attribute on <code data-anolis-spec=html>base</code> is now allowed to
      contain a relative URL.

      <li><p>All attributes that take URLs, e.g. <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-hyperlink-href>href</code> on the <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>a</code> element, now support IRIs if the document's
      encoding is UTF-8 or UTF-16.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-meta-http-equiv>http-equiv</code> attribute on <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>meta</code> is no longer said to be used by HTTP
      servers to create HTTP headers in the HTTP response. Instead, it is said
      to be a pragma directive to be used by the user agent.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-id>id</code> global
      attribute is now allowed to have any value, as long as it is unique, is
      not the empty string, and does not contain space characters.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-lang>lang</code> global
      attribute takes the empty string in addition to a valid language
      identifier, just like <code>xml:lang</code> does in XML.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-link-media>media</code> attribute on <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>link</code> now accepts a media query and defaults
      to "all".

      <li><p>The event handler attributes (e.g. <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=handler-onclick>onclick</code>) now always use JavaScript as the
      scripting language.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-li-value>value</code>
      attribute of the <code data-anolis-spec=html>li</code> element is no
      longer deprecated as it is not presentational. The same goes for the <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-ol-start>start</code> and <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-ol-type>type</code> attributes of the
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>ol</code> element.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-style>style</code>
      global attribute now always uses CSS as the styling language.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-tabindex>tabindex</code>
      global attribute now allows negative values which indicate that the
      element can receive focus but cannot be tabbed to.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-hyperlink-target>target</code> attribute of the <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>a</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html>area</code>
      elements is no longer deprecated, as it is useful in Web applications,
      e.g. in conjunction with <code data-anolis-spec=html>iframe</code>.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-script-type>type</code>
      attribute on <code data-anolis-spec=html>script</code> and <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>style</code> is no longer required if the scripting
      language is JavaScript and the styling language is CSS, respectively.</p>

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=attr-hyperlink-usemap>usemap</code> attribute on <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>img</code> no longer takes a URL, but instead takes
      a <span data-anolis-spec=html>valid hash-name reference</span> to a <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>map</code> element.

    </ul>

    <p>The following attributes are allowed but Web developers are discouraged from
    using them and instead strongly encouraged to use an alternative solution:</p>

    <ul>
     <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-img-border>border</code>
     attribute on <code data-anolis-spec=html>img</code>. It is required to have
     the value "<code>0</code>" when present. Web developers can use CSS
     instead.</p></li>

     <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
     title=attr-script-language>language</code> attribute on <code
     data-anolis-spec=html>script</code>. It is required to have the value
     "<code>JavaScript</code>" (case-insensitive) when present and cannot
     conflict with the <code data-anolis-spec=html
     title=attr-script-type>type</code> attribute. Web developers can simply omit it as
     it has no useful function.</p></li>

     <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html
     title=attr-a-name>name</code> attribute on <code
     data-anolis-spec=html>a</code>. Web developers can use the <code
     data-anolis-spec=html>id</code> attribute instead.</p></li>
    </ul>


    <h3 id="obsolete-elements">Obsolete Elements</h3>

    <p>The elements in this section are not to be used by Web developers. User
    agents will still have to support them and various sections in
    HTML define how. E.g. the obsolete <code data-anolis-spec=html>isindex</code> element
    is handled by the parser section.</p>

    <p>The following elements are not in HTML because their effect is
    purely presentational and their function is better handled by CSS:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html>basefont</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html>big</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html>center</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html>font</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html>strike</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html>tt</code>
    </ul>

    <p>The following elements are not in HTML because using them damages
    usability and accessibility:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html>frame</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html>frameset</code>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html>noframes</code>
    </ul>

    <p>The following elements are not included because they have not been
    used often, created confusion, or their function can be handled by other
    elements:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html>acronym</code> is not included because it has created a lot
      of confusion. Web developers are to use <code data-anolis-spec=html>abbr</code> for
      abbreviations.</li>

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html>applet</code> has been obsoleted in favor of
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>object</code>.

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html>isindex</code> usage can be replaced by usage of form controls.

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-dir>dir</code> has been obsoleted in favor of <code data-anolis-spec=html>ul</code>.
    </ul>

    <p>Finally the <code data-anolis-spec=html>noscript</code> element is only conforming in the
    HTML syntax. It is not allowed in the XML syntax. This is because in order to not only hide visually but also prevent the content to run scripts, apply style sheets, have submittable form controls, load resources, and so forth, the HTML parser parses the content of the <code data-anolis-spec=html>noscript</code> element as plain text. The same is not possible with an XML parser.</p>


    <h3 id="obsolete-attributes">Obsolete Attributes</h3>

    <p>Some attributes from HTML4 are no longer allowed in HTML. The
    specification defines how user agents should process them in legacy
    documents, but Web developers must not use them and they will not validate.</p>

    <p>HTML
    <span data-anolis-spec=html title="non-conforming features">has advice</span>
    on what you can use instead.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-a-rev>rev</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-a-charset>charset</code> attributes on
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>link</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html>a</code>.

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-a-shape>shape</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-a-coords>coords</code> attributes on
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>a</code>.

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-iframe-longdesc>longdesc</code> attribute on <code data-anolis-spec=html>img</code> and
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>iframe</code>.

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-link-target>target</code> attribute on <code data-anolis-spec=html>link</code>.

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-img-name>name</code> attribute on <code data-anolis-spec=html>img</code>
      (use <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-id>id</code> instead).

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-meta-scheme>scheme</code> attribute on <code data-anolis-spec=html>meta</code>.

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-object-archive>archive</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-object-classid>classid</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-object-codebase>codebase</code>,

      attributes on <code data-anolis-spec=html>object</code>.

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-param-valuetype>valuetype</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-param-type>type</code> attributes on
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>param</code>.

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-tdth-axis>axis</code>
      attribute on <code data-anolis-spec=html>td</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html>th</code>.
      
      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-td-abbr>abbr</code> and
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-td-scope>scope</code> attributes on

      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-table-summary>summary</code> attribute on <code data-anolis-spec=html>table</code>.
    </ul>

    <p>In addition, HTML has none of the presentational attributes
    that were in HTML4 as their functions are better handled by
    CSS:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-caption-align>align</code> attribute on <code data-anolis-spec=html>caption</code>,

    </ul>

    <h2 id="content-model">Content Model</h2>

    <p>Content model is what defines how elements may be nested &mdash; what is
    allowed as children (or descendants) of a certain element.

    <p>At a high level, HTML4 had two major categories of elements, "inline"
    (e.g. <code data-anolis-spec=html>span</code>, <code
    data-anolis-spec=html>img</code>, text), and "block-level" (e.g. <code
    data-anolis-spec=html>div</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html>hr</code>,
    <code data-anolis-spec=html>table</code>). Some elements did not fit in
    either category.

    <p>Some elements allowed "inline" elements (e.g. <code
    data-anolis-spec=html>p</code>), some allowed "block-level" elements (e.g.
    <code data-anolis-spec=html>body</code>), some allowed both (e.g. <code
    data-anolis-spec=html>div</code>), while other elements did not allow either
    category but only allowed other specific elements (e.g. <code
    data-anolis-spec=html>dl</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html>table</code>),
    or did now allow any children at all (e.g. <code
    data-anolis-spec=html>link</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html>img</code>,
    <code data-anolis-spec=html>hr</code>).

    <p class=note>Notice the difference between an element itself being in a
    certain category, and having a content model of a certain category. For
    instance, the <code data-anolis-spec=html>p</code> element is itself a
    "block-level" element, but has a content model of "inline".

    <p>To make it more confusing, HTML4 had different content model rules in its
    Strict, Transitional and Frameset flavors. For instance, in Strict, the
    <code data-anolis-spec=html>body</code> element allowed only "block-level"
    elements, but in Transitional, it allowed both "inline" and "block-level".

    <p>To make things more confusing still, CSS uses the terms "block-level
    element" and "inline-level element" for its visual formatting model, which
    is related to CSS's 'display' property and has nothing to do with HTML's
    content model rules.

    <p>HTML does not use the terms "block-level" or "inline" as part of its
    content model rules, to reduce confusion with CSS. However, it has more
    <span data-anolis-spec=html title="content categories">categories</span>
    than HTML4, and an element can be part of none of them, one of them, or
    several of them.

    <ul>
      <li>Metadata content, e.g. <code data-anolis-spec=html>link</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>script</code>.

      <li>Flow content, e.g. <code data-anolis-spec=html>span</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>div</code>, text. This is roughly like HTML4's
      "block-level" and "inline" together.

      <li>Sectioning content, e.g. <code data-anolis-spec=html>aside</code>,
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>section</code>.

      <li>Heading content, e.g. <code data-anolis-spec=html>h1</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>hgroup</code>.

      <li>Phrasing content, e.g. <code data-anolis-spec=html>span</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>img</code>, text. This is roughly like HTML4's
      "inline". Elements that are phrasing content are also flow content.

      <li>Embedded content, e.g. <code data-anolis-spec=html>img</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>iframe</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>svg</code>.

      <li>Interactive content, e.g. <code data-anolis-spec=html>a</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>button</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>label</code>. Interactive content is not allowed to
      be nested.
    </ul>

    <p>As broad changes from HTML4, HTML no longer has any element that only
    accepts what HTML4 called "block-level" elements; e.g. the <code
    data-anolis-spec=html>body</code> element now allows flow content. This is
    thus closer to HTML4 Transitional than HTML4 Strict.

    <p>Further changes include:

    <ul>

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>address</code> element now allows
      flow content, but with no heading content descendants, no sectioning
      content descendants, and no <code data-anolis-spec=html>header</code>,
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>footer</code>, or <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>address</code> element descendants.

      <li><p>HTML4 allowed <code data-anolis-spec=html>object</code> in <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>head</code>. HTML does not.

      <li><p>WHATWG HTML allows <code data-anolis-spec=html>link</code> and
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>meta</code> as descendants of <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>body</code> if they use microdata attributes.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>noscript</code> element was a
      "block-level" element in HTML4, but is phrasing content in HTML.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>table</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>thead</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>tbody</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>tfoot</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html>tr</code>,
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>ol</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>ul</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html>dl</code> elements are
      allowed to be empty in HTML.

      <li><p>Table elements have to conform to the <span
      data-anolis-spec=html>table model</span> (e.g. two cells are not allowed
      to overlap).

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>table</code> element now does not
      allow <code data-anolis-spec=html>col</code> elements as direct children.
      However, the HTML parser implies a <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>colgroup</code> element, so this change should not
      affect <code>text/html</code> content.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>table</code> element now allows the
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>tfoot</code> element to be the last child.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>caption</code> element now allows
      flow content, but with no descendant <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>table</code> elements.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>th</code> element now allows flow
      content, but with no <code data-anolis-spec=html>header</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>footer</code>, sectioning content, or heading
      content descendants.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>a</code> element now has a <span
      data-anolis-spec=html>transparent</span> content model (except it does not
      allow interactive content descendants), meaning that it has the same
      content model as its parent. This means that the <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>a</code> element can now contain e.g. <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>div</code> elements, if its parent allows flow
      content.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>ins</code> and <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>del</code> elements also have a transparent content
      model. HTML4 had similar rules in prose that could not be expressed in the
      DTD.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>object</code> element also has a
      transparent content model, after its <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>param</code> children.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>map</code> element also has a
      transparent content model. The <code data-anolis-spec=html>area</code>
      element is considered phrasing content if there is a <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>map</code> element ancestor, which means that they
      do not need to be direct children of <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>map</code>.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>fieldset</code> element no longer
      requires a <code data-anolis-spec=html>legend</code> child.

    </ul>


    <h2 id="apis">APIs</h2>

    <p>HTML has introduced many new APIs and have extended, changed or
    obsoleted some existing APIs.


    <h3 id="new-apis">New APIs</h3>

    <p>HTML introduces a number of APIs that help in creating Web
    applications. These can be used together with the new elements introduced
    for applications:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Media elements (<code data-anolis-spec=html>video</code> and <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>audio</code>) have APIs for controlling playback,
      syncronising multiple media elements, and timed text tracks (e.g.
      subtitles).
      
      <li><p>An API for form constraint validation (e.g. the <code
      data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-cva-setcustomvalidity>setCustomValidity()</code> method).

      <li><p>An API for <span data-anolis-spec=html
      title=concept-command>commands</span> that the user can invoke.

      <li><p>An API that enables offline Web applications, with an <span
      data-anolis-spec=html>application cache</span>.</li>

      <li><p>An API that allows a Web application to register itself for certain
      protocols or media types, using <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler>registerProtocolHandler()</code>
      and <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-navigator-registerContentHandler>registerContentHandler()</code>.</li>

      <li><p>Editing API in combination with a new global <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-contenteditable>contenteditable</code>
      attribute.</li>

      <li><p>Drag &amp; drop API in combination with a <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-draggable>draggable</code>
      attribute.</li>

      <li><p>An API that exposes the components of the document's URL and allows
      scripts to navigate, redirect and reload (the <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>Location</code> interface).

      <li><p>An API that exposes the session history and allows scripts to
      update the document's URL without actually navigating, so that
      applications don't need to abuse the fragment component for "Ajax-style"
      navigation (the <code data-anolis-spec=html>History</code> interface).

      <li><p>An API for base64 conversion (<code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-windowbase64-atob>atob()</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-windowbase64-btoa>btoa()</code> methods).

      <li><p>An API to schedule timer-based callbacks (<code
      data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-windowtimers-settimeout>setTimeout()</code> and <code
      data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-windowtimers-setinterval>setInterval()</code>).

      <li><p>An API to prompt the user (<code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-alert>alert()</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-confirm>confirm()</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-prompt>prompt()</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-showmodaldialog>showModalDialog()</code>).

      <li><p>An API for printing the document (<code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-print>print()</code>).

      <li><p>An API for handling search providers (<code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-external-addsearchprovider>AddSearchProvider()</code> and <code
      data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-external-issearchproviderinstalled>IsSearchProviderInstalled()</code>).

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>Window</code> object has been defined.
    </ul>

    <p>WHATWG HTML has further APIs that are not in W3C HTML5 but are separate specifications at the W3C:

    <ul>
      <li><p>An API for microdata.

      <li><p>An API for immediate-mode bitmap graphics (the <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=canvas-context-2d>2d</code> context for the
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>canvas</code> element).

      <li><p>An API for cross-document messaging and channel messaging (<code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-window-postMessage>postMessage()</code>
      and <code data-anolis-spec=html>MessageChannel</code>).

      <li><p>An API for runnings scripts in the background (<code
      data-anolis-spec=html>Worker</code> and <code

      <li><p>An API for client-side storage (<code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-localStorage>localStorage</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-sessionStorage>sessionStorage</code>).

      <li><p>An API for bidirectional client-server communication (<code
      data-anolis-spec=html>WebSocket</code>).

      <li><p>An API for server-to-client data push (<code data-anolis-spec=html>EventSource</code>).
    </ul>


    <h3 id="changed-apis">Changed APIs</h3>

    <p>The following features from DOM Level 2 HTML are changed in various ways:

    <ul>
      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-title>document.title</code> now collapses whitespace on
      getting.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-domain>document.domain</code> is made settable, which
      can change the document's effective script origin.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-open>document.open()</code> now either clears the
      document (if invoked with two or less arguments), or acts like <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-open>window.open()</code> (if invoked with
      three or four arguments). In the former case, throws an exception in XML.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-close>document.close()</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-document-close>document.write()</code> and
      <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-close>document.writeln()</code> throw an exception in
      XML. The latter two now support variadic arguments; they can add text to
      the document's input stream while it is still being parsed, or can imply a
      call to <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-open>document.open()</code> or be ignored altogether in
      some cases.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-getElementsByName>document.getElementsByName()</code>
      now returns all HTML elements with a <code>name</code> attribute matching
      the argument.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-form-elements>elements</code>
      on <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLFormElement</code> now returns an
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLFormControlsCollection</code> of <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>button</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>fieldset</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>input</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>keygen</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>object</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>output</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>select</code> and <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>textarea</code> elements. <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-form-length>length</code> returns the
      number of nodes in <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-form-elements>elements</code>.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-select-add>add()</code> on
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLSelectElement</code> now also accepts an
      integer as its second argument.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-select-remove>remove()</code>
      on <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLSelectElement</code> now removes the
      first element in the collection if the argument is out of bounds.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html>a</code> and <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>area</code> elements now stringify to their <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-hyperlink-href>href</code> attribute.

      <li><p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-click>click()</code>,
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-focus>focus()</code> and <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-blur>blur()</code> methods are now
      available on all HTML elements.

    </ul>

    <h3 id="document-extensions">Extensions to
    <code>Document</code></h3>

    <p>DOM Level 2 HTML had an <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface that
    inherited from <code>Document</code> and provided HTML-specific members on
    documents. HTML has moved these members to the <code
    data-anolis-spec=html>Document</code> interface, and extended it in a number
    of ways. Since all documents use the <code data-anolis-spec=html>Document</code> interface, the
    HTML-specific members are now available on all documents, so they are usable
    in e.g. SVG documents as well. It also has several new members:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-location>location</code>, <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-lastModified>lastModified</code> and <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-document-readyState>readyState</code> to
      help resource metadata management.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-document-dir>dir</code>,
      <code data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-document-head>head</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-document-embeds>embeds</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-document-plugins>plugins</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-document-scripts>scripts</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-document-commands>commands</code>, and a
      generic name getter, to access various parts of the DOM tree.
      
      <li><p>WHATWG HTML has <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-getItems>getItems()</code> for microdata.
      
      <li><p>WHATWG HTML and W3C HTML5.1 has <code
      data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-cssElementMap>cssElementMap</code> to accompany the CSS
      <code>element()</code> feature.
      
      <li><p>WHATWG HTML and W3C HTML5.1 has <code data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-document-currentscript>currentScript</code> which returns the currently
      running <code data-anolis-spec=html>script</code> element (or null).

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-activeElement>activeElement</code> and <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-document-hasFocus>hasFocus</code> to
      determine which element is currently focused and whether the <code
      data-anolis-spec=html>Document</code> has focus respectively.

      <li><p><code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-designMode>designMode</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-document-execCommand>execCommand()</code>,
      <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-queryCommandEnabled>queryCommandEnabled()</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-queryCommandIndeterm>queryCommandIndeterm()</code>,
      <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-queryCommandState>queryCommandState()</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-queryCommandSupported>queryCommandSupported()</code>, <code
      data-anolis-spec=html
      title=dom-document-queryCommandValue>queryCommandValue()</code> for the
      editing API.

      <li><p>All event handler IDL attributes. Also, <code data-anolis-spec=html
      title=handler-onreadystatechange>onreadystatechange</code> is a
      special event handler IDL attribute that is only available on
      <code data-anolis-spec=html>Document</code>.
    </ul>

    <p>Existing scripts that modified the prototype of <code>HTMLDocument</code>
    should continue to work because <code>window.HTMLDocument</code> now returns
    the <code data-anolis-spec=html>Document</code> interface object.


    <h3 id="htmlelement-extensions">Extensions to <code>HTMLElement</code></h3>

    <p>The <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLElement</code> interface has also gained several extensions
    in HTML:</p>

    <h3 id="obsolete-apis">Obsolete APIs</h3>

    <p>Some APIs are now either removed altogether, or marked as obsolete.

    <p>All IDL attributes that reflect a content attribute that is itself
    obsolete, are now also obsolete. For instance, the <code
    data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-body-bgColor>bgColor</code> IDL attribute on
    <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLBodyElement</code> which reflects the
    obsolete <code data-anolis-spec=html title=attr-body-bgcolor>bgcolor</code>
    content attribute.

    <p>The following interfaces are marked obsolete since the elements are
    obsolete: <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLAppletElement</code>, <code
    data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLFrameSetElement</code>, <code
    data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLFrameElement</code>, <code
    data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDirectoryElement</code> and <code
    data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLFontElement</code>.

    <p>The <code>HTMLIsIndexElement</code> interface is removed altogether since
    the HTML parser expands an <code>isindex</code> tag into other elements. The
    <code>HTMLBaseFontElement</code> interface is also removed since <!-- Anne managed to
    kill it --> the element has no effect.

    <p>The following members of the <code>HTMLDocument</code> interface (which
    have now moved to <code data-anolis-spec=html>Document</code>) are now
    obsolete: <code data-anolis-spec=html
    title=dom-document-anchors>anchors</code> and <code data-anolis-spec=html
    title=dom-document-applets>applets</code>.


    <h2 id="changelog">HTML Changelogs</h2>

    <p>The changelogs in this section indicate what has been changed between
    publications of the W3C HTML5 drafts (or between arbitrary dates in some cases), as well as changes in WHATWG HTML that do
    not affect W3C HTML5. Rationale for changes can be found in the <a
    href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/">public-html@w3.org</a> and <a
    href="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/">whatwg@whatwg.
    org</a> mailing list archives, and the <a
    href="http://blog.whatwg.org/category/weekly-review">WHATWG Weekly</a>
    series of blog posts. More fundamental rationale is being collected on the
    WHATWG <a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Rationale">Rationale</a> wiki
    page. Many editorial and minor technical changes are not included in these
    changelogs. Implementors are strongly encouraged to follow the development
    of the main specification on a frequent basis so they become aware of all
    changes that affect them early on.</p>

    <p>The changes in the changelogs are in rough chronological order.</p>

     was introduced to allow embedding of potentially hostile content
     inline. It is expected to be used together with the
     <code>sandbox</code> and <code>seamless</code> attributes.</li>
     <li>The <code>figure</code> element now uses a new element
     <code>figcaption</code> rather than <code>legend</code> because people
     want to use HTML long before it reaches W3C Recommendation.</li>
     <li>The <code>details</code> element now uses a new element
     <code>summary</code> for exactly the same reason.</li>
     <li>The <code>autobuffer</code> attribute on media elements was renamed

    </ul>

    <p>A whole lot of other smaller issues have also been resolved. The
    above list summarizes what is thought to be of primary interest to
    Web developers.</p>

    <p>In addition to all of the above, Microdata, the 2D context API for
    <code>canvas</code>, and Web Messaging (<code>postMessage()</code> API)
    have been split into their own drafts at the W3C (the WHATWG still
    publishes a version of HTML that includes them):</p>

    <p>Specific microdata vocabularies are gone altogether in the W3C draft
    of HTML5 and are not published as a separate draft. The WHATWG draft of
    HTML still includes them.</p>

     attribute matches the encoding of the document. (Note that it does not
     specify the value, it is just a talisman.)</li>

    <h3 id="changes-2008-01-22">Changes from 22 January 2008 to 10 June 2008</h3>

    <ul>
     <li>Implementation and authoring details around the <code>ping</code>
     attribute have changed.
     <li><code>&lt;meta http-equiv=content-type></code> is now a
     conforming way to set the character encoding.</li>
     <li>API for the <code>canvas</code> element has been cleaned up. Text
     support has been added.
     <li><code>globalStorage</code> is now restricted to the same-origin
     policy and renamed to <code>localStorage</code>. Related event
     dispatching has been clarified.
     <li><code>postMessage()</code> API changed. Only the origin of the
     message is exposed, no longer the URL. It also requires a second
     argument that indicates the origin of the target document.
     <li>Drag and drop API has got clarification. The
     <code>dataTransfer</code> object now has a <code>types</code>
     attribute indicating the type of data being transferred.
     <li>The <code>m</code> element is now called <code>mark</code>.
     <li>Server-sent events has changed and gotten clarification. It uses a
     new format so that older implementations are not broken.
     <li>The <code>figure</code> element no longer requires a caption.
     <li>The <code>ol</code> element has a new <code>reversed</code>
     attribute.
     <li>Character encoding detection has changed in response to feedback.

     <li>Web developer-defined attributes have been added. Web developers can add
     attributes to elements in the form of
     <code>data-<var>name</var></code> and can access these through the DOM
     using <code>dataset[<var>name</var>]</code> on the element in question.
     <li>The <code>q</code> element has changed to require punctuation
     inside rather than having the browser render it.
     <li>The <code>target</code> attribute can now have the value
     <code>_blank</code>.
